# 🚀 TypeScript Fundamentals Project Overview

Welcome to my TypeScript showcase!  
Deployed here: 👉 [Live Site on Netlify](https://alan7220.netlify.app/)

This project highlights essential TypeScript concepts through a clean, interactive, and well-organized web experience. 🌟

---

 🔥 Core Features

 1. Basic Data Types
- Created a well-designed page displaying at least 5 basic data types (string, number, boolean, array, tuple, etc.) 📚
- Sample code snippets are included to make understanding easier for everyone!

---

 2. Function Types in Action
- Developed a user interface using TypeScript to build and populate **Function Types**.
- Demonstrated function parameters clearly through UI examples. 🛠️

---

3. Interfaces + JSON Mapping
- Worked with a large JSON file and presented a new UI style different from other pages. 🎨
- Showcased:
  - ✅ `map()` over array data
  - ✅ Destructuring array elements
  - ✅ A professional and visually pleasing layout

---

 4. TypeScript Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Defined TypeScript classes complete with constructors. 🏗️
- Created a Class that implements an Interface** to show strong typing and structure.
- Illustrated key OOP principles:
  - 🧠 **Abstraction** – Hiding internal logic, showing only essentials
  - 🏰 **Inheritance** – Creating a hierarchy of related classes
  - 🛡️ **Encapsulation** – Protecting and controlling class data
  - 🎭 **Polymorphism** – Treating different classes through a common interface

---

 📸 Visual & UI Focus
- Each page is designed with careful attention to layout, readability, and aesthetics.
- Used consistent theming, clean fonts, and professional card layouts to create a pleasant browsing experience.

---

 ✨ Project Goals
- Make TypeScript concepts **easy to understand** through visuals and real-world examples.
- **Demonstrate mastery** of TypeScript's power in building dynamic, typed, and maintainable user interfaces.
